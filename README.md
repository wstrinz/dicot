Dicot
=====

Domain Independent Classifier Of Text (needs a more fun name)

Use Conditional Random Fields via the [wapiti](https://github.com/inukshuk/wapiti-ruby) gem to to recognize and extract arbitrary features from text.
Can be retrained as new data comes in.

Instructions coming eventually, for now see the specs.
